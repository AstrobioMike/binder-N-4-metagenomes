# N exo 4-metagenomes binder
An RShiny [binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment built with our [OSF site](https://osf.io/9kwn3/wiki/home/) to be able to explore the N-related metagenomic info. (The OSF site is private right now, so ask Mike about it if you don't have acess and want it.) 

<!-- > **Details and examples using this can be found at this [hackmd page](https://hackmd.io/@astrobiomike/N-exo-4-mg-exploring).** -->

**Click this launch binder badge to access the environment:**

<!-- This session only lasts as long as we're using it. Files can be uploaded to it and downloaded from it, but nothing will remain on the session/in the environment when it sits idle for too long (I think this might be like 10 minutes) or after it is closed. Clicking the launch badge again will open a new one with no retained files or work. -->

<!-- To get started, once the RStudio environment opens, click on the **`explore.R`** file in the bottom right panel under the "Files" tab 🙂 -->
